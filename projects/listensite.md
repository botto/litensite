#lITENsITE  
client side based content display system.  
I got the idea after becoming exhausted with server side software. For I wanted a simple and easy to use system that did not require a whole database backend and a frontend that could be taken down by too many requests.  
A few criteria were:
  * Low to no maintenance
  * Easy to update from any device
  * Fast and scalable
  * Easy to deploy

This left me with no solution out there. At least not one I could easily find. After attempting a few solutions in NodeJS and PHP I ended up just simply using client side based tech and let the web server do what it does best. Serve files.

Because I spend a lot of my time in the terminal and SSH I wanted an easy way to add new content. I settled on MarkDown because you can still read it without the output formating.

lITEN means small in Norwegian
